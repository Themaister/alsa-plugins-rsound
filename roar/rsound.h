   RSD_PORT: Set port. Expects (char *) in param. If not set, will default to environmental

   RSD_SAMPLERATE: Set samplerate of audio stream. Expects (int *) in param. Mandatory.
   RSD_BUFSIZE: Sets internal buffersize for the stream. Might be overridden if too small.

   RSD_LATENCY: Sets maximum audio latency in milliseconds, (must be used with rsd_delay_wait() or this will have no effect).
